# RIPN
Java implementation of the RIPN framework

Cyber-Physical Systems require advanced modeling frameworks to handle their hybrid nature, real-time adaptability, and environmental interactions. This paper introduces the Reactive Interpreted Petri Net (RIPN) approach, a novel extension of Petri nets that integrates a centralized knowledge repository, the BeliefStore, and supports the incorporation of Teleo-Reactive programs. RIPNs enable the modeling of both discrete and durative actions, providing a unified framework that combines formal analytical rigor with system adaptability. We propose a systematic method to integrate Teleo-Reactive programs into RIPNs, enabling seamless, goal-driven modeling and analysis together with the advantages of a goal-oriented approach. This framework supports rigorous analysis of properties such as safety, deadlock-freedom, and resource optimization.
